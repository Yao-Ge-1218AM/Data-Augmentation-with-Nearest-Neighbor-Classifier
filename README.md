# DANN: Data Augmentation with Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition

## Overview

DANN (Data Augmentation with Nearest Neighbor Classifier) is a novel approach designed to enhance few-shot learning (FSL) in Named Entity Recognition (NER) within the biomedical domain. The model combines semantic data augmentation with a nearest neighbor classification strategy, addressing data sparsity issues commonly found in medical NLP tasks.

Notebooks for medical named entity recognition with DANN model, used in the article "**Data Augmentation with Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition**" which was published in the MedInfo 2022.

Update (2024): The annotated data and the BERT trained model is now available

## Features

### Few-shot Learning: Efficiently learns from small labeled datasets, crucial for tasks with limited annotated medical data.
### Semantic Data Augmentation: Enhances input token representations using similar words identified through cosine similarity.
### Nearest Neighbor Classification: Employs multiple distance metrics (e.g., Manhattan, Euclidean) to improve entity detection accuracy.
